            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Being able to log in once and securely gain access to a variaty of shared or stand-alone resources is one of the most important parts of developing an enterprise system. Additionally, effectively determining permissions to said resources is equally important. Finally, ensuring that both these concepts are implemented with the best security and engineering practices is vital to ensure your central users and protect resources are safe against theft and break-in attempts.</p>
            <p>A3S makes this process simple for any project by offering all this right out of the box. It can be deployed on virtually any system, and integrate with virtually any technology.</p>
