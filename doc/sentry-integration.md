# Sentry Integration

[Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) provides open-source and hosted error monitoring that helps all software 
teams discover, triage, and prioritize errors in real-time. However, in order to use this functionality, [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) specific agent code needs to be inserted into the application. It is for this reason that it has been decided to not have [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) integrated by default. This document describes the process of integrating A3S with [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/), should that be desired.

# Basic Archictecture

[Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) monitoring consists of two components:

* The [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) server, which aggregates all the reported issues and exposes a UI for enabling teams to discover and address these issues.
* An application specific [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) client. This programming language specific client is integrated into the application at a code level to catch all exceptions and publish them to the [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) server.

# Setting Up A Sentry Server

## Docker-compose environment

Sentry provides cloud and on premise deployment options for the server side component of the server component. The following excerpt is a docker-compose configuration file that can be used to deploy a Sentry Server. Note, some configuration needs to be done prior to this environment being spun up. Please refer to the subsequent sections for these intructions.

```
version: '3.4'
x-defaults: &defaults
  networks:
    - a3s-development
  restart: unless-stopped
  image: sentry:9.1
  depends_on:
    - redis
    - postgres
    - memcached
    # - smtp
  env_file: .env
  environment:

    SENTRY_REDIS_HOST: redis
    SENTRY_POSTGRES_HOST: postgres
    # SENTRY_EMAIL_HOST: smtp

*Figure 1: Docker compose configuration file for bringing up a sentry server.*

## Configure the Docker-compose environment

Sentry requires some manual steps to be run using the docker-compose environment defined in figure 1. These are listed below and must be run **prior to `running docker-compose up`**. Assuming that the docker-compose file is called `sentry-docker-compose.yml`

* Create a secret key. Run:

```yaml
docker-compose run --rm web config generate-secret-key | tail -n 1 | tr -d '\r\n' | awk '{print "SENTRY_SECRET_KEY="$1}' > .env
```
* Migrate the database. Run:
```yaml
docker-compose -f sentry-docker-compose.yml run --rm web upgrade --noinput
```
* Create a user. Run:
```yaml
docker-compose -f sentry-docker-compose.yml run --rm web createuser
```
 **Note** 
This is an interactive process that will require human input.

## Bring Up the Sentry Server

Run

```yaml
docker-compose -f sentry-docker-compose.yml up
```

## Add a Project on the UI.

* Navigate to the [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) UI, available at `http://localhost:9000`. Sign in with the user that was created in the `Configure the Docker-compose environment` section above.
* Set up a project for the language your application is written in. **NB:** Make a note of the DSN for your project as this will need to be configured within the agent later on. An example of what this may look like is:

```
http://c0798c13b05c4d5c96401f02eb955ee7@localhost:9000/2
```

# Add Sentry Client

These instructions will vary per programming language. Documentation for each supported platform can be found [here](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/).
